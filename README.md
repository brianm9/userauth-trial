# userauth-trial
My trial run at creating user authentication and storing it on github

I am learning to web develop using ruby on rails - among other softwares, and am interested in learning how github works and is used to version control projects. Currently I am using Microsoft Team Foundation Server as well as Microsoft Visual Source Safe. So far I am loving github.
